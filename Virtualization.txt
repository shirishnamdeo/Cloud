Hypervisor: 

Type 1 Hypervisor (sits on top of BareMetal):
	More frequently used
	Lower latency

Type 2 Hypervisor (a layer of Host OS sits between the physical layer and Hypervisor, also knows an Hosted Hypervisor)
	Example Oracle Virtual Box, VMWare
	Higher lateny

Over these Hypervisor, independed VMs can be spinoff/hosted.


Because these Virual Machines are independent, they can be moved from one Hypervisor to onother Hypervisor on completely 
different physical machine (almost instantaneously which gives flexibility and portability within the environment).




Virtualization Benifits:
1. Cost Benifits (Run multiple different environments from one piece of infrastructure, reduce physical infrastructure footprint)
   Do not need to run as many servers, save electiticity, save maintenance cost.

2. Agility & Speed
   Spinning up a Virtual Machines is relatively easy and quick (ex if we want new environment for testing)


3. Lowers the Downtime
   Virtual Machines can be moved from one Hypervisor to another on a different physical server.

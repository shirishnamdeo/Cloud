DAS -> Directly Attached Storage
SAN -> Storage Area Network
NAS -> Network Attached Storage (over LAN)


Directly Attached Storage:
-- https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/direct_attached_storage.html

Directly attached to the computer/server accessing it, as opposed to storage accessed over a computer network (NAS). 
DAS isn't part of a storage network.
It could be SCSI connection (Small Computer System Interface), can be USB, FireWire etc.
Examples of DAS include hard drives, solid-state drives, optical disc drives, and storage on external drives.

But it doesn't have ability to scale.



Storage Area Network (Block based storage):
-- https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SAN.html

SAN is a high-speed network of storage devices that also connects those storage devices with servers.
Provides block-level storage that can be accessed by the applications running on any networked servers.
SAN storage devices can include tape libraries and disk-based devices, like RAID hardware.
LUN (Logical unit number) -> Group of disk present to particular service.
SAN be used as a service to virtulization environment.
SAN is present to a server or a service as that if it is a disk which is attached to local computer.
Protols used are iSCSI and FiberChannel


For large organizations with many servers, SAN offers better performance and flexibility than DAS, along with potential cost savings, although SAN hardware can be costly.

SCSI vs iSCSI


Raid Groups
Storage Pools




Network Attached Storage (File Based Storage)
Dependent on SMB, NFS protocols acting a file server.
Have their own Operating=Systems

RAID -> Redundant Array of Independent  Disks
RAID-0,1,2,3,4,5,6,1+0

Hypervisor: 

Hypervisor is the key to enable Virtualization.
Its a software installed on top of Hardware, creating a virtualization layer.
Acting as a platform for the VMs to be created on.
It manages the sharing of the physical resources into virtual.



Type 1 Hypervisor (sits on top of BareMetal), also know as Bare-Metal Hypervisor:
	This type of Hypervisor has its own operating system, and can be installed directly on the Computer Hardware.
	More frequently used
	Lower latency

	VMWare Type 1 Hypervisor is ESXi Server (an Operating System)


Type 2 Hypervisor (known as Hoster Hypervisor):
	This Hypervisor is a Software Application that is installed on a Host Operating System, that create virtualization 
	layer, in which we can create our Virtual Machines.
	Example Oracle Virtual Box, VMWare
	Higher lateny

	VMWare Type 1 Hypervisor is VMWare Workstation



Over these Hypervisor, independed VMs can be spinoff/hosted.


Because these Virual Machines are independent, they can be moved from one Hypervisor to onother Hypervisor on completely 
different physical machine (almost instantaneously which gives flexibility and portability within the environment).




Virtualization Benifits:
1. Cost Benifits (Run multiple different environments from one piece of infrastructure, reduce physical infrastructure 
   footprint)
   Do not need to run as many servers, save electiticity, save maintenance cost.

2. Agility & Speed
   Spinning up a Virtual Machines is relatively easy and quick (ex if we want new environment for testing)


3. Lowers the Downtime
   Virtual Machines can be moved from one Hypervisor to another on a different physical server.

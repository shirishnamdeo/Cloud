Buckets (A Cloud Storage unit, and stores Object data)

Object Storage -> Cloud Storage -> Buckets

Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data. 
Everything that you store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. 

You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you 
cannot nest buckets. 
Because there are limits to bucket creation and deletion, you should design your storage applications to favor intensive
object operations and relatively few buckets operations.



When you create a bucket, you specify a globally-unique name, a geographic location where the bucket and its contents 
are stored, and a default storage class.
The default storage class you choose applies to objects added to the bucket that don't have a storage class specified 
explicitly.

After you create a bucket, you can still change its default storage class, to any class supported in the bucket's 
location; however, you can only change the bucket name and location by deleting and re-creating the bucket.




Bucket names:
-- https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming#requirements

Bucket names have more restrictions than object names and must be globally unique, because every bucket resides in a 
single Cloud Storage namespace.
Q. Globally unique for a project (for across all applicaations on Cloud??)

Also, bucket names can be used with a CNAME redirect, which means they need to conform to DNS naming conventions.



Bucket labels:
Bucket labels are key:value metadata pairs that allow you to group your buckets along with other Google Cloud resources 
such as virtual machine instances and persistent disks.

For example, you can use labels to create a team key that has values alpha, beta, and delta, and apply the team:alpha, 
team:beta, and team:delta labels to different buckets in order to indicate which team is associated with those buckets.

Cloud Storage == Object Storage



Hierarchy
Cloud Storage uses a flat namespace to store objects. 
However, some tools (for example, Google Cloud Console and gsutil) can work with objects as if they are stored in a 
virtual hierarchy, as a convenience.


Projects
All data in Cloud Storage belongs inside a project. A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, and billing, 
authentication, and monitoring settings for those APIs. You can have one project or multiple projects.


Namespace
There is only one Cloud Storage namespace, which means every bucket must have a unique name across the entire Cloud 
Storage namespace. Object names must be unique only within a given bucket.

Persistent Disk == Block Storage

High-performance block storage for virtual machines and containers.

Fast and flexible block storage:
Google Persistent Disk is durable and high performance block storage for Google Cloud Platform.
Persistent Disk provides SSD and HDD storage which can be attached to instances running in either Compute Engine or 
Google Kubernetes Engine. 
Storage volumes can be transparently resized, quickly backed up, and offer the ability to support simultaneous readers.


Share data easily
Persistent Disk offers unique multi-reader capability. With multi-reader mounting, many virtual machines can read data 
from a single Persistent Disk and sharing content is a snap. 
Attaching a disk to more virtual machines does not affect aggregate performance or cost; each machine gets a share of 
the per-disk performance limit.



Good For:
	Disks for virtual machines
	Sharing read-only data across multiple virtual machines
	Rapid, durable backups of running virtual machines
	Storage for databases

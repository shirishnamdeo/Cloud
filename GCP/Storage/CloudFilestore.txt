Cloud Filestore is a managed file storage service for applications that require a filesystem interface and a shared 
filesystem for data.

Filestore gives users a simple, native experience for standing up managed Network Attached Storage (NAS) with their 
Google Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine instances.

The ability to fine-tune Filestoreâ€™s performance and capacity independently leads to predictably fast performance for 
your file-based workloads.

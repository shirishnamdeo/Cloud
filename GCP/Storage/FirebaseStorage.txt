Firebase Cloud Storage == Object Storage

Scalable storage for user-generated content from your app.


Good For:
User-generated content
Uploads over mobile networks


Firebase Cloud Storage is a modern technology that allows for storing and managing various media content generated by 
mobile app users.

One of its biggest advantages is reliability. Firebase SDK for Cloud Storage works regardless of the network quality.
In other words, if a file stops uploading because of slow Internet connection, the process will be automatically 
restarted. For regular users, this feature saves minutes of waiting.


From a security viewpoint, Firebase SDK for Cloud Storage can be integrated with Firebase Authentication which provides
a simple and user-friendly mechanism of authentication for developers. 
It allows you to use a declarative security model to enable access based on the name of a file, its size, content type,
and other kinds of metadata.


Firebase Cloud Storage SDK also uses a declarative data protection language which allows you to manage the access to the
files in the storage and make them public or private.

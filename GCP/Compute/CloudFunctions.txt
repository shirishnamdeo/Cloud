Cloud Functions (currently in beta) is the next level up from App Engine in terms of abstraction - no instances!
It allows developers to deploy bite-size pieces of code that execute in response to different events, which may include 
HTTP requests, changes in Cloud Storage, etc.


The biggest difference with App Engine is that functions are priced per 100 milliseconds, while App Engine's instances 
shut down only after 15 minutes of inactivity. 
Another advantage is that Cloud Functions execute immediately, while a call to App Engine may require a new instance and
cold-starting a new instance may take a few seconds or longer (depending on runtime and your code).

This makes Cloud Functions ideal for 
(a) rare calls - no need to keep an instance live just in case something happens 
(b) rapidly changing loads where instances are often spinning and shutting down, and possibly more use cases.

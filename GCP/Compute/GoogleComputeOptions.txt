[Platform Overview - Compute (Google Cloud Essentials)]
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmBOv8z1D0



Compute Engine (enables to provision, start and connect a virtual machine. Enable to create single VM instances, machine
               types, OS image, region)
               Ability to add GPU's/TPU's to the instance
               Fine grained Security access conrol
               Https conectivity
               Live migration of running applications
               Preemptible VMs

               Complete control but with this comes management overhead


Google Cloud Functions
				Serverless
				For Cloud Functions to work you don't have to provision a cluster or deal with server configs, pay only
				for usage. Only when the code is running. No traffic - No cost. 
				Large scale app developmet a bit of an issue.

				To not worry about the VM's but only to focus on code.
				Lot of Triggers supported on the Buckets. (only on buckets? Is this tightly coupled with Cloud Storage?)
				No. triggers are supported with a lot of storage technologies like Pub/Sub, Databases, even compute 
				engine instances changing states.
				Can also be invoked using HTTP requests (means a user visit the URL and the function does the required)


Google App Engine
				Managed platform
				Serverless benifits (for large scale application, say with multiple services)
				Can deply source code
				A lot more configuration possible for developers, such as services, versioning and traffic splitting.
				App Engine applications can be build in multiple services, with different languages, each can be scaled 
				independently.
				Each service can offer multiple versions all active at the same time.

Google Kubernetes Engine
				For Container
				A fully managed version of Kubernetes.
				Can deply the containerized application to GKE, which offers a productioned infrastructure

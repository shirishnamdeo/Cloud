App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service. It means that you simply deploy your code, and the platform does everything else 
for you. 
For example, if your app becomes very successful, App Engine will automatically create more instances to handle the 
increased volume.


One more important distinction: 
Projects running on App Engine can scale down to zero instances if no requests are coming in. 
This is extremely useful at the development stage as you can go for weeks without going over the generous free quota of 
instance-hours. Flexible runtime (i.e. "managed VMs") require at least one instance to run constantly.

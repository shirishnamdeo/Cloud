FaaS -> Function As A Service

No service to manage and No Cluster to setup, provision or upgrade.
Infrastructure will be auto-scaled to meet the load demand.
Only billed for the resources consumed



Developers write a function that is triggered on an event or an incoming http request.
This function code can talk to a database and to other services, before it generates another event or simply sends the
response back.


Google Cloud Function support multiple programming languages (Python/NodeJs/Go/Java etc)
Simply deploy the functions along with the list of dependencies (which will resolved directly in the cloud) and 
configure the event that will trigger its execution.

PaaS -> Platform As A Service

IasS -> Is a set of compute, storage and network resources that have been virtualized by a vendor so that a user can access 
and configure them any way they want.
In design we have a concept called users called personas, and the personas for the IasS is a System Admin / IT Admin.


PaaS -> It takes advantage of all the virtualized resources from IasS and then just abstract them away so the users doesn't have to worry about managing any of those virtualized resources.
The users for PaaS is usually a Developer.


SaaS -> Software as a Service is just software that you don't have to install on your machine and you don't have to update manually and the user for SaaS could be anyone.
It is usually charged as a Subcription model rather than a one time licence fee.


SaaS < PaaS < IasS

So as we move down, we are increasing complexity in terms of your knowledge and management of infrastructure and resources. And going up increases your ease of use.

Vendor Provides:
	Servers
	Storage
	Networking
	Virtualization
	Middleware
	OS
	Renting

Develope Provide:
	Data
	Appilation


PROS of using PaaS:
-> Fast and Easy (to get an app up and running)
-> Easy to create and delete the resources (which for example we have a Proof-Of-Concept for a conference, which we want to spin it up before the conference and delete it right after, then we are not paying for the whole month), result in cost benifit.
-> Tools like DevOps tools and APIs are provided from vendors which we can quickly plug in our app and not have to worry about these.


CONS:
-> Lack of Control
-> Vendor lock-in (difficult to migrate an apps from one vendor to another)
-> Performance at scale (compared to Bare Metal)
